203	In the 1640’s the Dutch inhabitants of New Amsterdam built a 12′ wall to keep the bad hombres out. In 1664 the British ignored the wall and took New Amsterdam by sea. It’s now called New York.

617	Wayne LaPierre in 1999 — before gun manufactures started selling more guns to fewer people and decided the only way to maintain their profit margin after their demographic died off was to force guns onto the next generation. #CPAC #CPAC2018 pic.twitter.com/OYlj3Hp0yT — Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) February 22, 2018
618	This what is confusing to me … you can’t have Confederate flags … you take down historical statues because they are racist but the 44th POTUS picks the guy who painted these pictures to paint his presidential portrait and that’s just fine?
